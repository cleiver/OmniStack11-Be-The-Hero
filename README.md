## ðŸ’¼ The Project
A project developed during the [OmniStack week](https://rocketseat.com.br). It consists of an application where ONGs and volunteers can meet and work together.

The project is divided in 3 parts: back-end, front-end and mobile.

### The back-end

This is where we have all the code to store the data. As this is a simple application developed during a week, it is a simple API with lots of room to improvement.

### The front-end

The front-end was developed using ReactJS and it's composed of ONG registration and incidents registrations. It's mainly an interface for the ONGs.

### Mobile app

The mobile app was developed using React Native and [expo](https://expo.io). It's the interface for people that want to help ONGs. Here we have incidents listing and ways to contact the ONGs.

## ðŸ“‹ Probable Roadmap
- Host somewhere
- improve code quality and functionalities
