A project developed during the [OmniStack week](https://rocketseat.com.br).

The project is divided in 3 parts: back-end, front-end and mobile.

## The back-end

This is where we have all the code to store the data. As this is a simple application developed during a week, we just have to groups of data and a simple and simulated login. It was developed as a REST API.

## The front-end

The front-end was developed using ReactJS and it's composed of ONG registration and incidents registrations. It's mainly an interface for the ONGs.

## Mobile app

The mobile app was developed using React Native and [expo](https://expo.io). It's the interface for people that want to help ONGs. Here we have incidents listing and ways to contact the ONGs.
